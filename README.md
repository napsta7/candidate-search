# Candidate Search

## Description
This is a candidate search application that calls the GitHub API to display random GitHub users. The user of the application can cycle through random users and choose to either reject them and view the next one, or save them as a potential candidate and then move to the next one. The saved candidates page displays a table of previously saved candidates.

## IMPORTANT NOTE
I used code that was supplied/corrected by the edX Xpert Learning Assistant for this assignment.
